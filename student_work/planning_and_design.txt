Part I: Planning & Design (15 pts)

* Decide on a game idea and core goal
* Game rules and player actions are written or sketched out
* Main objects (player, obstacles, goals, enemies, etc.) are identified
* Sketch a simple plan showing how the game will work step-by-step

Game Idea:
Flappy Bird
Core goal: Survive as long as possible to get highscores

Game Rules:
- If you hit a green pipe head-on, you die
- The bird is always flying towards the pipes
- Passing through a pipe gives +1 score

Major Game Elements:
- Player (bird)
- Obstacles (green pipes)
- Goals (highscore)

Gameplay Process:
- Bird starts on the ground
- Pressing a button moves your bird up by a certain amount of lines
- You can always move up, but you must fall to move down
- Once you inevitably hit a pipe, the bird dies, and if you passed enough pipes, you get a highscore

Code Planning:
- Figure out what emojis we need
- Figure out how to color the backgrounds of strings
- Figure out how to randomize the pipes (large dictionary it picks from?)
- Figure out how to make the bird jump lines if a button is pressed
- Figure out how to make a button always be able to be pressed
